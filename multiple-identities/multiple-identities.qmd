# Introduction

Increasingly, we are presented with data in which respondents report *multiple* identities, whether these be *gender identities*, *racial identies*, *ethnic identities*, or *religious identities*. 

In our training, we may be familiar with thinking about visualizing, or analyzing, data when respondents report a *single* identity, but less sure of how to present information when respondents report *multiple* identities.

In this evolving set of notes I hope to think through these issues. Currently, the notes center around the use of Stata, but I hope to think through these issues in R as well.

# Simulated Data

In this example, I use simulated data on a set of simulated identities, `A`, `B`, `C`, `D`, and `E`.

It turns out to be useful that in this data, the identities are coded as `1/0`. `1` indicates that the respondent reports that identity, while `0` indicates that the respondent does not report that identity.

A sample of the data is listed below.
 
```{r}

multiple_identities <- read_dta("multiple-identities.dta")

pander(head(multiple_identities))

```

# Graphing

We make use of a useful *statistical trick*. The mean of a dichotomous variable, e.g. the mean of `A`, is the *proportion* of individuals with identity `A`.

In Stata, `graph bar`, lets us graph the *means of variables*,  *the categories of variables*, or the *means of variables over the categories of other variables*.

```{r}

knitr::include_graphics("graph-bar.png")

```

So, we use the following command:

```{stata, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}

graph bar A B C D E 

```

```{r, out.width="75%"}

knitr::include_graphics("mybar1.png")

```

We can add some options to our graph command.

```{stata, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}

graph bar A B C D E, ///
title("Percentage With Each Identity") ///
legend(order(1 "A" 2 "B" 3 "C" 4 "D" 5 "E")) ///
scheme(s1color)

```

```{r, out.width="75%"}

knitr::include_graphics("mybar2.png")

```

# Statistical Analysis

TBD

# More Complex Thinking About Patterns of Multiple Identities

We can start to think about the patterns of multiple identities.

The Stata command `egen` (extensions to generate), will allow us to create a variable that contains the *patterns* of different identities.

Visualizing these patterns will take some thinking ...

```{stata, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}

egen pattern = group(A B C D E), label

tabulate pattern

```

```{verbatim, echo=TRUE}

tabulate pattern

group(A B C |
       D E) |      Freq.     Percent        Cum.
