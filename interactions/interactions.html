<p>I’ve heard somewhere–I unfortunately forget exactly where–that a statistical model is nothing more than a principled statement about the data, that can be tested against the data. I think of moderation in that context.</p>
<p>Moderation is a kind of “statistical story” about different groups in the data.</p>
<p>As we build up to the idea of moderation, we are telling various “stories” about the data, and testing whether they are accurate.</p>

<p><span class="math inline">\(\beta_2\)</span> is thus the <em>difference in intercepts</em> between the two groups.</p>
