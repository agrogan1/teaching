# Be Kind; Be Motivated; Be Less Wrong {.smaller .scrollable background-color="black"}

> But there come times—perhaps this is one of them—when we have to take ourselves more seriously or die, when we have to pull back from the incantations, rhythms we've moved to thoughtlessly, and disenthrall ourselves, bestow ourselves to silence, or a severer listening ..." [@Rich1984]

# Complex Answers Hidden Inside Simple Questions

I have been thinking a lot lately about the idea that statistical questions are often seemingly simple questions, that contain complex answers, or answers that have complex operationalizations.

One thing that I often say in teaching is that because so many of the outcomes we study are so important–and are often unequally allocated–we want to make sure our answers are as precise, and as close to correct, as we can make them. It turns out that failing to understand some of the hidden complexities of statistical thinking may lead to providing very wrong answers to important questions.

Complex structures produced with simple rules

## Ideas

Each of these structures is based upon simple rules that produce a complex set of outcomes [@Stewart2017]. A nautilus shell is a logarithmic spiral, a structure that depends upon maintaining a constant angle with the center as the structure expands [@Livio2002]. The Mandelbrot set is a complex pattern that emerges from some simple rules about iterating the values of a complex function [@Mandelbrot].

> "If you suddenly and unexpectedly feel joy, don’t hesitate. Give in to it. There are plenty of lives and whole towns destroyed or about to be. We are not wise, and not very often kind. And much can never be redeemed. Still, life has some possibility left. Perhaps this is its way of fighting back, that sometimes something happens better than all the riches or power in the world. It could be anything, but very likely you notice it in the instant when love begins. Anyway, that’s often the case. Anyway, whatever it is, don’t be afraid of its plenty. Joy is not made to be a crumb. [@Oliver2010]

# Imposter Syndrome {.smaller .scrollable}

> "Academic life is full of learning, excitement, and discovery. However, academics also experience professional challenges at various points in their career, including repeated rejection, impostor syndrome, and burnout. These negative experiences are rarely talked about publicly, creating a sense of loneliness and isolation for people who presume they are the only ones affected by such setbacks. However, nearly everyone has these experiences at one time or another, and thus talking about them should be a normal part of academic life." [@Jaremka2019]
