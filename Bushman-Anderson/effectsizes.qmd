# Cohen's Standards

@Cohen1992 proposed effect size standards for correlations of .10 (small), .30 (medium), and .50 (large).

# Bushman and Anderson

In contrast, @Bushman2001 ask us to think about the correlations of many associations that we think are serious or important from an intervention, public policy, or public health perspective.

Effect sizes are *approximated* from a Figure in @Bushman2001.

        text =  ~Correlation,
        name = "Effect Sizes",
