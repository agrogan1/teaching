Differences In The Means Of Two Groups
===============================================================

Intuitively, if the *confidence intervals* of two variables overlap, we would expect that the two variables would not differ to a degree that is statistically significant.

However, as the brief example below illustrates, it is possible for two variables to have *overlapping confidence intervals*, yet to be different to a degree that is *statistically significant*.

clear all // clear the workspace

set seed 3846 // set random seed

set obs 100 // 100 empty observations

generate x1 = rnormal(100, 10) // x1 has mean of 100, sd of 10

generate x2 = rnormal(102, 10) // x2 has mean of 102, sd of 10

ci means x1 x2 // confidence intervals of the two variables overlap

ttest x1 == x2 // t-test finds significant differences between x and x2
