# About Me {.smaller}

[https://agrogan1.github.io/](https://agrogan1.github.io/)

* I do research on families and children, parenting, neighborhoods and schools
* I have strong interests in social justice.  I was originally a community organizer, and also served as a Peace Corps Volunteer in Ghana, West Africa.
* I do a lot of work researching physical punishment of children. A number of years ago, I published an analysis of 50 years of research on corporal punishment that you may have read about in the media.  Don’t spank kids! I continue to do research on physical punishment, but am increasingly focusing on positive parenting.
* I teach in the areas of research and social policy and evaluation.
I have taught courses on *Statistics For SP&E Majors* and *Data Visualization*. 
* A few years ago, I was a *Technical Advisor* fielding queries from students with challenging advising questions.

# Take Attendance

# Advising Stuff {.smaller}

* <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">Please take the opportunity to send me an e-mail and we will schedule a time during weeks 2-3 of classes.  We’ll set up 10 minutes just to say “hello” and check in on everything, including the courses you are scheduled for.</span> <span style="background-color: #00FFFF">We can do some of that scheduling right when we’re done talking as a group.  Mondays and Tuesdays are particularly good for me those weeks. I can meet in person Thursday afternoons.</span>
* Disabilities—the SSW faculty want to be very sensitive to mental and physical disabilities.  However, because of University policy, we are unable make accommodations for disabilities unless you take steps to explicitly inform us about the accommodations that you require.

# Advising Stuff (2) {.smaller}

* Exemptions (explain process) – if you have exemptions, this frees you up to take electives or to try and fill requirements from later on in the curriculum.  Exemptions are only for classroom based courses not field courses.
* Changing pathways area is something that you should think about this week
* Changing from 16 to 20 month, or *vice versa*, becomes substantially more difficult once field work has started.
* Two pathways ties up your course schedule but reserves time in field.
* Lots of help on campus—If you run into problems down the road, I am a person you can come to and talk to.
