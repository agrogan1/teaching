"Why can’t numbers be beautiful too? 

We all talk of beautiful words, art, buildings
 and they’re not part of the natural world, either. 
An *x* in Algebra is no more abstract than 
an idea in philosophy, just more useful. 

. . .

But it can’t be use that makes the difference. 
Keats found beauty in a Grecian urn, 
surely practical at some time 
and no one is blind to the beauty of symmetry. 

. . .

We all get Blake’s awe of the tiger’s stripes. 
Why not awe at Gaussian curves? 

##

Of course, I know there is no great beauty in a single number, 
in a four or a seven or an eight, but it is the same 

. . .

with the alphabet. Where is the wonder in a *b* 
or a *k* or a *t*? It is only the combinations, 
the meanings, the relationships between 
the letters that make the words and sounds we love. 

. . .

– And so, why can’t my numbers be beautiful to me? 
Why the scorn, the doubt in your face? Do you think 
I am brittle and dusty as old paper? 

. . .

Look again. See the numbers shine in my eyes"
